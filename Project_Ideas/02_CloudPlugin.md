# PyLabFlow Cloud Plugin

**Description:**  
Enable PyLabFlow to run in cloud environments like Google Colab and Kaggle.  
Currently, PyLabFlow is local-only and requires a filesystem and Python environment. The project will integrate Google Drive to allow cloud-based usage.

**Motivation:**  
Many students and researchers use Colab or Kaggle for experiments. Enabling cloud execution increases accessibility and collaboration.

**Skills Required:**  
- Python  
- Google Drive API  
- Cloud workflows  
- PyLabFlow internals  

**Deliverables:**  
- Google Drive integration plugin  
- Colab/Kaggle compatibility  
- Example notebooks demonstrating cloud usage  

**Suggested Milestones:**  
1. **Basic integration:** Implement Google Drive connectivity for storing/loading components.  
2. **Cloud compatibility:** Ensure PyLabFlow works in Colab and Kaggle environments.  
3. **Example workflows:** Provide fully functional cloud-based examples with documentation.  

**Mentors:** To be assigned
