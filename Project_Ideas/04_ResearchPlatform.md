# Collaborative Research Platform

**Description:**  
Build a platform where researchers can create profiles, connect to Google Drive, Colab, or Kaggle, and collaborate in “rooms” for specific research projects. Each room will allow shared experiment design, component development, and workflow management via PyLabFlow.

**Motivation:**  
Current PyLabFlow is researcher-specific. Collaboration requires centralized profiles, cloud integration, and shared workspaces.

**Skills Required:**  
- Python  
- Web frameworks (Flask/Django/FastAPI)  
- OAuth for authentication  
- PyLabFlow internals  

**Deliverables:**  
- User profiles with authentication  
- Room creation and collaboration  
- Example shared workflows  
- Documentation  

**Suggested Milestones:**  
1. **Authentication & profiles:** Implement user login, profile management, and OAuth integration.  
2. **Room management:** Allow creation of rooms, inviting collaborators, and sharing experiments.  
3. **Collaborative workflow testing:** Test multiple users editing and running shared workflows.  

**Mentors:** To be assigned
