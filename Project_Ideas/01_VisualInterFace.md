# Visual Interface for Component Abstraction

**Description:**  
Create an interactive visual interface for PyLabFlow components using [NiceGUI](https://nicegui.io/).  
The goal is to make PyLabFlow as flexible as Jupyter Notebook, but focused on modular, component-based workflows.

**Motivation:**  
PyLabFlow components currently require coding to connect and execute workflows. A visual interface will allow researchers to design, run, and debug workflows more intuitively.

**Skills Required:**  
- Python  
- NiceGUI or similar Python web GUI framework  
- PyLabFlow component structure  
- Optional: Frontend basics (HTML/CSS)

**Deliverables:**  
- UI prototype for single components  
- Support for chaining multiple components  
- Example workflows demonstrating end-to-end execution  
- Documentation and usage guide  

**Suggested Milestones:**  
1. **UI prototype:** Create visual representation of one component with input/output mapping.  
2. **Component chaining:** Enable multiple components to be linked and executed in sequence.  
3. **Full workflow integration:** Test a complete workflow and produce examples and documentation.  

**Mentors:** To be assigned
